        When you work with us, you are part of a team of committed
        collaborators. All aspects of our softwared development process are
        integrated,interactive and agile.
      </p>
      Our approach unifies design, development and product management to create
      exceptional products. We start each project by understanding your business
      goals, the user's needs and the product requirements. Then we help
      translate them into effective and elegant solutions.

      <h2>SERVICES</h2>
      <p>
        Before we sign a contract or write a line of code our team will spend
        the necessary time needed to understand your product vision.
      </p>
      The outcome of this scoping session is proposal or high-level statement of
      work. Based on your requirements, we can provide a complete offering or
      just the pieces you need.

      <h2>WHAT WE DO</h2>

      <h3>DESIGN</h3>
      <p>
        Our design practice offers a full range of services including brand
        strategy, interaction and visual design and user experience testing.
        Throughout your project, our designers create and implement visual
        design and workflows, solicit user feedback and work with you to make
        sure what gets built is what is needed.
      </p>

      <h3>DEVELOPMENT</h3>
      <p>
        All engineers are fluent in the latest enterprise, mobile and web
        development technologies. They collaborate with your team to write, and
        improve code on a daily basis, using proven practices such as
        test-driven development and pair programming.
      </p>

      <h3>PRODUCT MANAGEMENT</h3>
      <p>
        Planning and development is iterative. Because we are constantly coding
        and testing, the products we build are always ready to go live. This
        iterative process allows for changes as business requirements evolve.
